A MySQL SELF JOIN is a type of join where a table is joined with itself. This can be useful when you have a table with hierarchical data or when you need to compare records within the same table. Here's how you can perform a MySQL SELF JOIN with a hypothetical "Employees" table:

Suppose we have a hypothetical "Employees" table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    ManagerID INT
);
```

In this table, each employee has an "EmployeeID," "FirstName," "LastName," and a "ManagerID" that represents the ID of their manager in the same table.

Now, let's populate the "Employees" table with some sample data:

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, ManagerID)
VALUES
    (1, 'Pankaj', 'Sharma', NULL), -- Pankaj is the top-level manager
    (2, 'Nishant', 'Patel', 1),    -- Nishant reports to Pankaj
    (3, 'Kiran', 'Desai', 1),      -- Kiran reports to Pankaj
    (4, 'Tanvi', 'Mehta', 2),      -- Tanvi reports to Nishant
    (5, 'Kritek', 'Singh', 2);     -- Kritek reports to Nishant
```

Now, let's explore how to use a MySQL SELF JOIN to retrieve data from the "Employees" table to find managers and their direct reports:

1. Using a SELF JOIN to find employees and their managers:

```sql
SELECT e.FirstName AS EmployeeFirstName, e.LastName AS EmployeeLastName,
       m.FirstName AS ManagerFirstName, m.LastName AS ManagerLastName
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Employees m ON e.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID;
```

Result:

```
| EmployeeFirstName | EmployeeLastName | ManagerFirstName | ManagerLastName |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Pankaj            | Sharma           | NULL              | NULL            |
| Nishant           | Patel            | Pankaj            | Sharma          |
| Kiran             | Desai            | Pankaj            | Sharma          |
| Tanvi             | Mehta            | Nishant           | Patel           |
| Kritek            | Singh            | Nishant           | Patel           |
```

In this query, we use a SELF JOIN to join the "Employees" table with itself based on the "ManagerID" and "EmployeeID" columns. We alias the table as "e" for employees and "m" for managers. This query retrieves the names of employees and their respective managers.

2. Using a SELF JOIN to find employees without managers:

```sql
SELECT e.FirstName AS EmployeeFirstName, e.LastName AS EmployeeLastName
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN Employees m ON e.ManagerID = m.EmployeeID
WHERE m.EmployeeID IS NULL;
```

Result:

```
| EmployeeFirstName | EmployeeLastName |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Pankaj            | Sharma           |
```

In this query, we use a SELF JOIN to find employees who do not have managers. We use a LEFT JOIN and filter the results to include only rows where there is no match for the manager.

A MySQL SELF JOIN can be helpful when you need to work with hierarchical data or compare records within the same table, such as finding employees and their managers or identifying employees without managers.
